    <H1>MY FIRST HTML PAGE</H1>
    <P>I am Ogbonna Ogochukwu</P>
    <p>I studied sociology and I am currently in the process of a career switch. I enrolled with STUTERN through the afro tech girls scholarship and my track is software development <b>(front end).</b></p>
    <p>Besides general enjoyment, I am a lover of words and as such, I like to read and write. I consider myself quite crafty because I also enjoy making pretty things.</p>
